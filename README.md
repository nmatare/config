# config

## Scope
This repository contains configuration files that I use to setup a workstation.

## Index

- [x] `.vimrc`
- [x] `.bashrc`
- [x] `.tmux.conf`

## Installation

To install run `install.sh` in your home directory. To startup tmux/vim run
`project name`, where name is the name of your project. This assumes that all
your projects are in the home/projects directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmatare/config.git && cd config 
./install.sh
project my_project
``` 

## Notes

- Make sure `vim-gtk` is installed!
